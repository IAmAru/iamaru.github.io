      <h2>1game1week - Week 1 (1/3/25)</h2>
      <p>Hello, and thanks for reading!<br>
        It's been a long time since I've posted here. I can't really blame personal issues or whatever, I just got lazy.<br><br>

        In 2022, I tried to do 1game1week. It's kind of self-explanatory. It's essentially done in the interest of both saving money and getting through the games I've purchased over the years.
        It oddly enough makes it feel like it's something I have to do, and not necessarily just a stress-relief or a hobby, so it incentivizes me to actually play stuff and not just doomscroll on my phone.
        When I last did 1game1week in 2022, I was able to get through 24 games, which... well... that's just shy of 50%, so... win?<br><br>

        I only really consider a game "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game, or got to a non-bad ending. If I play Nier Automata, I won't die at the beginning and say I "beat" it due to getting Ending W.<br>       
        I don't intend to talk too much about the games I play here, or to spoil them. Just kind of a surface-level mention of what I thought.
        <br><br>

        Anyways, to summarize, 1game1week helps to make me stop buying more games and burn through my backlog. You can see my progress and any random updates in my Backloggery, which is linked in the sidebar.

        <br>
        Thankfully, I'm already done with the first game, which helps a bunch by giving me time to be ahead on the next.<br>
        It might look silly, but here's the way I'll do it:<br><br>

        GAME: Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.3 Tatarigoroshi<br>
        PLATFORM: Steam Deck<br>
        FINAL PLAYTIME: 29.2 hours<br><br>

        The game I finished for this week is Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.3 Tatarigoroshi. I'm a fan of visual novels, but Higurashi has always been tough for me to get through for a variety of reasons.<br>
        I actually started reading Tatarigoroshi back in early 2023, if I recall correctly. I'm unsure if I can say laziness / other games got the better of me or if I was just trying to avoid the characters getting hurt.<br>
        It's always a good plot in these games, this one just packs several punches. I wonder if Ryukishi07 saw the kind of stuff he wrote about here, in real life.<br><br>

        I played the game on Steam, using the 07th Mod patch for the original sprites, voice over, NVL, etc.<br>
        I'm excited to read the next chapter, Himatsubushi. I've been told that it's the shortest in the entire series, which will probably be another 1game1week entry.<br>
        I don't really expect to be able to do 52 games this year, although it'd be very nice. This weekend, I'm going to try to play Zone of the Enders, on PS3.

        <br><br>Thanks for reading! If you need to contact me for any reason, please feel free to email me at aru@hoshikawa-aru.com.<br>
