      <h2>1game1week - Week 4 (1/22/25) - Atelier Totori ~ Adventurer of Arland</h2>
      <p>Hi again everyone! It's week 4! (1/22 -> 1/29) <br>
        Can you believe I still don't have my GPU?<br>
        <br>
        New games from 1/15 -> 1/21:<br>
        <br>
        Sonic Heroes (GC) (1/18) (At GameStop of all places lol)<br>
        <br>
        Currently, my backlog (https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_) is at +2.<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Atelier Totori ~ Adventurer of Arland<br>
        PLATFORM: PlayStation 3<br>
        STARTED ON: 1/9<br>
        BEATEN ON: 1/15<br>
        <br>
        Now this is a pretty hefty game.<br>
        It's my fourth Atelier game. I've played Rorona Plus, Marie Remake, and Ryza 1 before.<br>
        Even still, man, this was a challenge. I was unable to get the True Ending in time before the 6 year mark was over. I was decently far, but early game being a little tough on the wallet kinda stumped me. It's the first game I haven't been able to do so!<br>
        I bought this game off Suruga-ya half a year or so back. It's funny. Suruga-ya is a Japanese import marketplace, but I was able to get the ESRB version of Totori. I guess rarities like this happen. Some foreigner living in Japan sold off their collection? Who knows?<br>
        <br>
        Wasn't until the last couple months in Year 6 that I found out you can use Spring Cups to "farm" money from Pamela.<br>
        Shame! It would've been really helpful to know a few years before. I might've been able to make it then. I was already at the tower to defeat the evil demon guy which I think is the last requirement. Dunno if I needed the fully upgraded license either. I only made it to Cobalt (Rank 9).<br>
        <br>
        It was a treat to get back to Arland. Even hearing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFawWSyu1XU">Atelier Rorona theme</a> made me smile.<br>
        <br>
        I'd love to play through this game again, at least before playing Meruru. I really want to see the True Ending.<br>
        If you haven't played an Atelier game before, I'd very much recommend it! The newest game, Atelier Yumia, will be coming out in March. I've already scheduled PTO to play it all day on release so hopefully you can tell I am excited.<br><br>

        Currently, I'm reading through Higurashi When They Cry: Himatsubushi on Steam Deck. It's decently short, so I hope I can get through it soon. I'm running out of buffer room between my posts.<br>
        I've mentioned it before, but I'd love suggestions on what to play! Please feel free to shoot me a message to recommend your favorite game. I might already even have it and it might just be accumulating dust on my shelf.<br>
        <br>
        See you next week! 

        <br><br>Thanks for reading! If you need to contact me for any reason, please feel free to email me at aru@hoshikawa-aru.com.<br>
