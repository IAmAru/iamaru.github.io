      <h2>1game1week - Week 3 (1/16/25)</h2>
      <p>It's only been a couple days, welcome to week 3! (1/15 -> 1/21) <br>
        My GPU is (still) in the shop getting its HDMI port replaced. Guy has had it since 1/2. I honestly should've just done it myself.
        From this post on, I will be mentioning the games I picked up the week prior. So, this week, I will mention the games I bought from 1/8 to 1/14.<br><br>

        New games:<br><br>

        Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance (PS5)<br>
        WitchSpring R (PS5)<br>
        Shadows of the Damned - Hella Remastered (PS5)<br>
        Senran Kagura Reflexions (Switch)<br><br>

        Currently, my backlog (https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_) is at +1.<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br><br>

        GAME: Clock Tower: Rewind<br>
        PLATFORM: PlayStation 5<br>
        BEATEN ON: 1/9<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 3 hours<br><br>

        Pretty short one this time around.<br>
        It's kind of strange to play a horror game like this in January, isn't it? Isn't it something that's best suited for something like Halloween, or October?<br><br>
        
        I agree! I totally should've played this in October! Of last year! I bought the physical version of this game. Unfortunately Limited Run Games was the publisher. Some of the people who read my posts might not know, but LRG sucks at delivering on time. One of my friends and I joked once that a good insult isn't "I hope you die" or something. A better one is "I hope your favorite game gets a remake published by LRG". That's painful. That's horrifying. And it's completely possible. Beware.<br>
        So I received this game in the mail a little bit before Christmas... And I thought, "what a wonderful game to celebrate the holidays... not". I was pretty excited to play this game, though, so. Good a time as any.<br><br>

        I liked the experience, as odd as it can be. I can tell the port was made by people who care a lot about presentation in retro games, especially looking at the display modes. (2x integer scale, "full", etc). Felt like I could drop the PS5 down to 1080p and pipe it to my scaler to have a clean, sharp image.<br>
        Didn't get all the endings or trophies, but I would like at some point to double back to do so. It feels like I'm leaving some stuff on the table here by just putting it down after 3 hours.<br>
        Some of the new features like "Rewind", where you quite literally rewind time by pressing a button, were... okay? The thing is that a lot of the game is decently slow. If I enter a room to run from the Scissorman / Bobby, and then realize, "dang, that was a bad call, I'll rewind"... the rewind only really takes you back so far, to where you're already making the choice that you want to rewind.<br>
        Maybe I didn't understand it. Am I out of touch...? No. It's the game who is wrong.
        
        To be honest though, it's refreshing to finally play this one. Ever since that one JonTron video a decade ago, the game's PS1 release has been pretty pricy. Still is.<br>
        So many people crown this as part of the beginning to survival horror and it definitely shows. I'd recommend it.<br><br>

        Currently, I'm not playing anything. I finished up Atelier Totori last night. I've got Shadows of the Damned - Hella Remastered "on deck", so whenever I get some time to play (probably over the weekend), I'm gonna give it a shot. Though, I definitely do take recommendations on what to play! One of my other friends has recommended I get off my butt and play Final Fantast XVI which will likely be sometime soon.<br>
        Let's see... I think, games I'm already planning on playing soon are probably Shadows of the Damned, FFXVI, Higurashi 4, Zone of the Enders 2 (not in that particular order). Gets pretty packed.<br><br>

        Oh, as an extra: on 1/8, I beat Deathsmiles on Switch, but I'm finding it hard for myself to really do a 1g1w post for it, or even acknowledge it as part of 1g1w. It was just half an hour of me not knowing what was going on and shooting randomly. Maybe, if I go back and do a 1 coin clear or invest a lot more time to do all the scenarios, I'll change my mind. But it feels rather cheap to buy a very short game and count it for this.<br>
        Am I being too picky? Maybe. Probably.

        <br>
        See you next week!
