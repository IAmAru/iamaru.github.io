      <h2>1game1week - Week 17 (4/23/25) - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 17! (4/23 -> 4/30)<br>
        So there I was... sitting and waiting for Switch 2 preorders to go live... and I remembered I didn't write a post today so I'm here panicking at 10:40PM wondering if I'll be able to finish before midnight.<br>
        <br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +16 (lower is better).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages<br>
        PLATFORM: 3DS<br>
        STARTED ON: 3/27<br>
        BEATEN ON: 3/30<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 27 Hours<br>
        <br>
        After the behemoth that was Atelier Yumia, I really wanted to sit down and play a fun, simple, short puzzle game. I've actually had both Oracle games on my 3DS since they were released back in 2013, and I beat Seasons back then as well.<br>
        For those who don't know, Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons are two sides of a coin. They're functionally more action vs. puzzle gameplay, with Ages being the Puzzle side of the coin.<br>
        By beating one, you can get a password (like one of those cool save passwords from before games had clock batteries) that you can use to start a 'game link' playthrough on the other. It doesn't do too much other than unlock the 'true' final boss and give you an extra heart.<br>
        Armed with the password in hand, I decided to see what the sequel / game link was all about.<br>
        <br>
        This was supposed to be a short fun game that I'd play for a couple days. How did it turn out to be 27 hours...?<br>
        Well...<br>
        It's really unfortunate, but due to the bad habit of letting my 3DS die because I don't want to stop playing, I ended up fully losing my entire save... right at the final boss.<br>
        That's right. I didn't beat it and my entire progress was wiped.<br>
        <br>
        I know what you're thinking... 'wow! that's really frustrating! I bet you didn't go back and try to do it again, right?'<br>
        Well you'd be wrong. I was so incredibly pissed at both the fact I just lost my save and at myself for letting it happen, so as you can probably surmise by now, I did exactly what a scorned little gamer would do. I started from the very tippy top.<br>
        Once again, armed with the password, I started out. Since this is mostly a puzzle-based game, it was decently simple as I had 'just' done all the puzzles.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, I defeat the true final boss Ganon, save the princess, the whole works. I watch the credits, satisfied at getting back at the cruel, cruel fate that tried to stop me from making this post.<br>
        The End screen... Finally...<br>
        Out of pure curiosity, I decide to boot my save to see if there's any cool postgame thing I could do. And something's not right.<br>
        It turned out that I had not manually saved since the sixth dungeon (out of eight), so in the eyes of the game, even though I just came out of the End screen, I did not have a beat-the-game save file. Once again, you can probably guess my reaction. I was mostly just mad I didn't see this coming.<br>
        So there I was... massaging my temples and telling myself it'd just be a few hours. It'd be okay. And just a few hours it was.<br>
        <br>
        ONCE AGAIN, I beat the sixth, seventh and eight dungeons, and beat the final boss and Ganon. I make sure to manually save *before* I saved the princess. And *that* did the trick. Finally. After all this time. I had a save file that just let me roam the world with no issues, and reach the credits whenever I wanted.<br>
        While it's all really funny in retrospect I was so incredibly frustrated at how much I had to go through just to beat a short 12 hour Gameboy game two and a quarter times. This should not have taken that long.<br>
        At it least was fun... fun puzzle games like these never get old. I'll hold firm that I prefer this Zelda model over the open-world ones any day. You go into a dungeon, you solve puzzles, you beat the bad guy, and you're done. It's already a fun, large world...<br>
        <br>
        That's all for now. I got my Switch 2 preorder in, so I'm going to bed. See you all next week! Stay safe!
