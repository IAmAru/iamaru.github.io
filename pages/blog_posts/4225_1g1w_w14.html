      <h2>1game1week - Week 14 (4/2/25) - Idol Janshi Suchie-Pai Saturn Tribute</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 14! (3/26 -> 4/2)<br>
        How about that Switch 2 Direct, huh?<br>
        It's been a bit over 12 hours since the reveal, so more info has started to come out. I'm... cautiously optimistic.<br>
        Though, I'll say: 1080p120 undocked is insane. Nintendo cannot be outclassed with hybrid handhelds. Wow. Really.<br>
        But... 90 dollar games? "Game keys"? It just feels like an insane step backwards and normalizing- no, encouraging the crazy jump in price games have had.<br>
        Since Nintendo is inflating the price crazily, a bunch of people will follow suit. Eventually, the hobby might be too expensive...<br>
        <br>
        The price of the console itself doesn't even sound too bad. The killer will be the tariffs associated with it. Since it's being manufactured in Vietnam, it's going to be taking a 46? percent tariff.<br>
        That's not chump change...<br>
        I feel conflicted. I'm happy, and I'm excited for the new console. I think the software looks really cool. I'm excited to play Legends ZA. But... man.<br>
        There's just a bunch of unraveled threads that will need to sort themselves out for me to be properly hyped.<br>

        <br>
        New games from 3/26 -> 4/1:<br>
        <br>
        None!<br>

        <hr>
        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +15 (lower is better).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Idol Janshi Suchie-Pai Saturn Tribute<br>
        PLATFORM: Nintendo Switch<br>
        STARTED ON: 3/8<br>
        BEATEN ON: 3/10<br>
        <br>
        It's just mahjong. It's really just mahjong, so don't look into it.<br>
        <br>
        That's all for now. See you next week!
