      <h2>1game1week - Week 7 (2/14/25) - Higurashi When They Cry: Chapter 4 - Himatsubushi</h2>
      <p>Happy Valentine's Day! It's Week 7! (2/12 -> 2/19) <br>
        <br>
        New games from 2/5 -> 2/11:<br>
        <br>
        Casual Romance Club (PC) [Thanks to my friend GreyCart!]<br>
        System Shock Remake (PS5) [Recommended by my friend Das!]<br>
        <br>
        Currently, my backlog (https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_) is at +6 (lower is better).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Higurashi When They Cry: Chapter 4 - Himatsubushi<br>

        BEATEN ON: 2/3<br>
        <br>
        ...Peace? In this economy?<br>
        Took me a few days. For being such a short chapter, it answered so many things for me, and made me raise even more questions. I guess that's why they're called Question Arcs.<br>
        <br>
        While I would really love to talk about this, but I really also don't want to spoil anything for anyone reading this post.<br>
        So I won't! It's a decently short 'in between' for Question and Answer arcs that was apparently unplanned. Ryukishi didn't have enough time to finish up Meakashi (Ch5), so this came instead.<br>
        Interestingly enough, at the beginning, the "difficulty" indicator mentions that there is no room for speculation, and that everything presented is 'as is'. I wonder if this really means it, literally, that everything seen here is just as it was, and to draw any future conclusions knowing this is "true".<br>
        Super really excited to start Meakashi. I have a whole Google Doc with thoughts and theories and things that I'm linking between chapters (even though a lot of it is probably wrong) hat a couple of my friends have been seeing. I hope my blind theorizing is fun to them.<br>
        <br>
        Last week, I mentioned I may finally get myself to start Zone of the Enders 2, and I did! On stream no less. So it was super fun when a random power blip made my PS3 turn off so my friends got to see my live sad reaction over losing an hour of gameplay and just giving up. Fun times...<br>
        No worries, probably will start back up tonight / tomorrow. The whole thing happening last night was just a bit demoralizing so I opted to just end stream and go to sleep lol.<br>
        As always, please feel free to shoot me a message to recommend your favorite game. I'd love to hear what you guys have to recommend.<br>
        <br>
        See you next week! 

        <br><br>Thanks for reading! If you need to contact me for any reason, please feel free to email me at aru@hoshikawa-aru.com.<br>
