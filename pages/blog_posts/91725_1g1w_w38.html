      <h2>1game1week - Week 38 (9/17/25) - Resident Evil 4 Remake and Resident Evil 3 Remake</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 38! (9/17 -> 9/24)<br>
        When you guys go on a trip, do you just clean your home like crazy before leaving? While setting up things to be ready to go, I found myself cleaning... there's just something nice about coming back to an organized, clean space. It's like, "wow, I'm so tired from my vacation, I don't wanna clean!". Is it like, pre-cleaning, in a sense?<br>
        Well, that's been my day so far. Setting up computers, patching to a new OS (I'm gonna miss Windows 10...), setting up a few virtual machines, making sure course materials are good to go...<br>
        I'm excited for this trip. It'll probably be a bit hectic, trying to balance touristy stuff and actual learning / work, but it'll be a nice change of pace from my day-to-day. It's been a little stressful recently.<br>
        I've booked quite a few things to go to and my schedule's starting to become a bit full, but I'm still trying to find stuff to do. It's nice planning for stuff like this!<br>
        Since I'll be busy, I'll actually be pre-typing the Week 39 post and I'll "try" to upload it day of, just to keep myself going there. While I want to enjoy my vacation, I don't want it to throw off the weekly rhythm I have going on.<br>
        <br>
        Anyways!<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        New games from 9/10 -> 9/16:<br>
        <br>
        None! (Total 14)
        <br>
        <hr>
        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +3 (lower is better, -3 from last week).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Resident Evil 4 Remake and Resident Evil 3 Remake<br>
        PLATFORM: Xbox Series X<br>
        GENRE: Action<br>
        STARTED ON: 9/4<br>
        BEATEN ON: 9/7<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 11 hours and 1 minute / 2 hours and 35 minutes<br>
        <br>
        Hey time out! Isn't it supposed to be ONE game one week?<br>
        Well... yeah. You got me there. There's a lot of games that I just don't really want to make a dedicated post for, or feel "low effort", but not "low effort" enough to not highlight them at all. Stuff like, "I've played this before", or "I played something really similar". We'll be seeing this again, come week 40!<br>
        In this case, the "low effort" one is RE3, since I've already played it a few times on PC before. I just happened to also own it for Xbox, so I thought it'd be nice to just play it to get my total backlog score down (currently at +3!), as well as compare how I feel about it vs. Resident Evil 4 Remake.<br>
        Honestly, weirdly enough, I really liked Resident Evil 3 Remake a lot better than 4. I've never played the original 3, so the remake was my reference point. I have played a LOT of the original RE4, though!<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        This may sound weird, but I think that a lot of the character from the original game was stripped in the remake. Random fun things, enough to the point where it was probably taking itself "too" seriously. The thing that mostly grabbed my attention was throwaway one-liners.<br>
        Stuff like, "bitch in the red dress", or "no thanks, bro!" or that one line Saddler has about Americans watching too many action movies, or throwing a knife at Salazar just to aura farm. It may just be me, but those really just added a lot of character to the game's script. It wasn't all serious zombie/Plagas killing, it was just a... fun game that wasn't taking itself all too seriously, about zombie/Plagas killing.<br>
        It's not like this game didn't have its moments, though. Leon doing a backflip off a wall instead of just walking backwards when the chainsaw sisters come and stop him from taking the crank was really, really funny. It's definitely a shift in tone.<br>
        Crafting mechanics were a bit annoying. I'd rather just get ammo...<br>
        Also, it really, really felt like the action sequences, although mostly faithful to what's actually in the original RE4, were a bit overdone and they got a little annoying to deal with.<br>
        In RE3 remake, for example, I could just... walk away. Action sequences never really felt mandatory, and there really wasn't a lot of them. The only real required action sequences were with the Carlos segments and bosses, but even those were part of the exploration rather than just being an action sequence.<br>
        Since we're comparing to RE3 remake, I really, really, really missed the dodge mechanic. It felt so synergetic with the game, since the whole point is picking your battles. The parry mechanic, by definition, is more of a battle tool, rather than a tool to evade it.<br>
        I think I'd have a lot more fun if I was able to evade some of the battles, but maybe that's just me sucking at the game (wouldn't be the first time).<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        Still, RE4 Remake was really enjoyable. In a vacuum where I'm not comparing it to its predecesor, it's a really cool fun game. It had fun surprises, good character work, even if I complained about it parrying was awesome, graphics looked phenomenal. REengine continues to show off how good it is.<br>
        I complained about one-liners being missing, but the Wesker one-liner at the end with him saying "Billions" made me laugh incredibly hard.<br>
        Also, it was really nice for them to add a cameo of my friend Billy the fish.<br>

        As for Resident Evil 3 Remake, there wasn't a lot new for me. Felt nice going through the game again, even if I knew pretty much all I had to do, remembered strats, etc. I don't know if it's known with my friends who read these posts, but during the pandemic I used to speedrun Resident Evil 2 Remake and tried 3 for a little while, but didn't really get into all that much. I was able to get an S rank in PC, though... a few years ago, anyway.<br>
        I appreciate its focus on movement and fluidity in your actions. I've never played the original, so I can't quite whine and moan about it like I can RE4, lol.<br>
