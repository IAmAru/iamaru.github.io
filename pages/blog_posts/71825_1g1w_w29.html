      <h2>1game1week - Week 29 (7/16/25) - Professor Layton and the Last Specter</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 29! (7/16 -> 7/23)<br>
        I forgot to make a post... Sorry :'(<br>
        Japanese classes started last week! It was really intimidating but fun. We're doing some immersion stuff with it so we had to pick JP names. I thought Aru would be lame... so I went with Shiki, the protagonist from Tsukihime.<br>
        There was no class today unfortunately. My teacher is competing in a kendo tournament.<br>
        I don't really have a huge amount of updates... I upgraded my CPU recently, changed out my server from a computer I saved from e-cycling to one I built using parts I got from slowly upgrading my PC, fixed up some issues with the VPN to my home network... Dunno. It's been busy, sure, but not necessarily eventful.<br>
        It's nice not having something to complain about for once.<br>
        <br>
        Anyways!<br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +14 (lower is better, -1 from last week).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Professor Layton and the Last Specter<br>
        PLATFORM: Nintendo DS<br>
        GENRE: Puzzle Adventure<br>
        STARTED ON: 7/4<br>
        BEATEN ON: 7/5<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 14 hours and 37 minutes (tracked via in game time)<br>
        <br>
        I don't think there's a lot I can really say about this, just a really fun puzzle adventure game.<br>
        Picked this one out of the backlog because recently, I got myself the Bluray for Professor Layton Eternal Diva. Decently old movie, but it wasn't until last month or so that it got a Bluray print in the States. That's cool, isn't it?<br>
        Truly a Layton-esque experience, as they say.<br>
        The last time I played a Layton game was actually around this time, three years ago, for 1g1w 2022... weirdly enough, it was *also* week 29... I didn't really plan that out, but the coincidence is interestingly funny.<br>
        I told this story back then, so it's a little bit lame to repeat it. To be honest, I'm trying to really come up with things to say to pad the post.<br>
        Even though I've barely played four of the games in the series, I've actually followed the Layton series since before I moved to the US. One day, my dad was going on a business trip to the US and showed me a few games, asked me to pick which one I wanted. Among those, he showed me Phantom Hourglass and the first Layton game, Curious Village. Since I was... probably somewhere around 8 or 9, I obviously picked Phantom Hourglass.<br>
        I remember him looking disappointed. He tried to convince me a bit to get Curious Village, but accepted that the child wearing the Zelda fit wouldn't pick some random Br*tish guy with a hat over Link. When he came back, he handed me Phantom Hourglass… and then he handed me Curious Village. He really thought I’d like it, so he just got me it anyway. He was right, so here I am 18 years later playing game 4! ...even though Game 4 released 14 years ago, and I received it for Christmas 11 years ago! It's fine, right...?<br>
