      <h2>1game1week - Week 18 (4/30/25) - Higurashi When They Cry: Chapter 6 - Tsumihoroboshi</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 18! (4/30 -> 5/7)<br>
        It's late at night right now. I actually totally forgot it was Wednesday...<br>
        This week, I officially crossed over the 29 games beat for 2025. That means this year has been the most games I've finished, in a year. I was really happy crossing that barrier.<br>
        Of course, it's supposed to come naturally, if I'm really trying to beat a game every week... I'd have to beat at least 52, right?<br>
        I guess it's just a natural thing. If you run a mile everyday, your time will eventually cross whatever goal you set your mind to. Maybe that's why it feels exhilirating when you actually attain your goal.<br>
        It's probably not that simple. But it'd be neat if it was, wouldn't it?<br>
        <br>
        Game pickups should be slowing down for a little while now, I hope. I haven't been too active in buying new things. Though, I do have a few open preorders... I'm hoping at least next week, I can say there'll be no new games to add to the backlog.<br>

        New games from 4/23 -> 4/29:<br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +13 (lower is better).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Higurashi When They Cry: Chapter 6 - Tsumihoroboshi<br>
        PLATFORM: PC (Steam Deck)<br>
        STARTED ON: 3/26<br>
        BEATEN ON: 4/7<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 23.6 Hours<br>
        <br>
        Since this will be my fourth (and counting) Higurashi post this year, there is very little I can say anymore.<br>
        As of today, I'm actually just about to enter the final eight-hour stretch of the last chapter in Higurashi, Matsuribayashi.<br>
        All the secrets have been revealed. It's been really fun.<br>
        <br>
        I mentioned it before, but Higurashi is a social game, where you collaborate and talk with your friends to figure out the mystery. Only using your own thoughts often gets you nowhere.<br>
        There's quite a few things I would never have even considered, that were completely right, that were pointed out to me as theories.<br>
        While it's great and all to finally have the truth in my grasp... it's a bittersweet feeling. It's the same feeling as when you wish something just would never end.<br>
        I will never be able to experience Hinamizawa's mystery again. I will never get to theorize and be completely wrong (or completely right) about different aspects of the novel again.<br>
        As you can probably tell by the total playtime, Higurashi is a huge novel. That's why... it'll be sad once it's all over, even if it's a happy end.<br>
        <br>
        That's all for now. It's time for me to go to bed. See you all next week! Stay safe!
