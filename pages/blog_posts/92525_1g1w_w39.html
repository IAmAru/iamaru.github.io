      <h2>1game1week - Week 39 (9/25/25) - Signalis</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 39! (9/25 -> 10/1)<br>
        I'm in my hotel room right now after a very long day, writing before I head out to a show. This was my fourth day here. It's a little overwhelming.<br>
        I don't think I've actually mentioned where I am. I'm at a conference in Las Vegas for classes. I flew in on Sunday, and watched a show that night. On Monday, I went to a roller coaster in some New York-like attraction in The Strip. It was short, but really fun.<br>
        Today, I decided it would be a phenomenal idea to walk 40 minutes to get to a ramen restaurant away from The Strip. While it was delicious... it didn't really help that I failed to bring a phone charger and ended up getting lost trying to get back to The Strip. Honestly, even saying, "oh, the hotel is that way!", the city's walkways are so deceptive that I can't really decipher where to walk.<br>
        In short. I spent probably two or so hours in total aimlessly walking trying to get back to my hotel. When I got back, I was exhausted. I brought my vlogging camera, so I'll always be able to look back at the saga of me walking around like an idiot trying to find my way.<br>
        <br>
        All that said, it's been fun... my classes are from 9am - 5pm. When going to conferences like this, I'd typically be thinking, "wow! so little time to go out and explore the city!". But this is a nocturnal city, so it's actually been really easy to find stuff to do. I've got a couple shows booked to go to Wednesday and Thursday, and I'm really looking forward to them.<br>
        <br>
        Anyways!<br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +4 (lower is better, +1 from last week).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Signalis<br>
        PLATFORM: PS4<br>
        GENRE: Survival Horror<br>
        STARTED ON: 9/7<br>
        BEATEN ON: 9/9<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 7 hours and 35 minutes<br>
        <br>
        This may sound really silly, but I had no idea Signalis was survival horror until I started playing. It was a fantastic experience.<br>
        It borrows various gameplay mechanics from early survival horror games, as well as various stylistic and aesthetic choices various pieces of media. Silent Hill 2, Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell, Resident Evil (even down to a room playing Moonlight Sonata), there's a reference to The Shining...<br>
        The game uses a top-down (but angled?) camera, rather than something like over-the-shoulder third person or having different camera positions depending on which room you're in, like in other survival horror games.<br>
        I'm not entirely sure whether to interpret that as just, "that's how it is", or if it's a choice specifically made for the narrative. I'm not going to delve too much into its narrative, or theorizing, but the story was truly engaging.<br>
        Oh! Speaking of stylistic choices. This game actually has a CRT filter that adds both scanlines and a fisheye effect. It paired really, really well with the low-poly models and the 2D spriteart. I wish I could show you, but it's been over 14 days since I took them and the PS App only has a 14-day retention on screenshots.<br>
        I'd be able to get them if I was home, but... well...<br>
        <br>
        In games like this, you're kind of meant to "pick your battles", and try to be as efficient as you possibly can be in navigating the rooms / solving puzzles. This game lays its map out for you to be able to do exactly this as be as efficient as you can be, which is definitely appreciated. Sometimes, backtracking feels like a pain. Being given a shortcut to the beginning areal after finishing a puzzle going the long way is awesome.<br>
        A bit of a tangent, but this game is divided in three acts. One of the things your character, Elster, has at her disposal is a map you can access. This is more so useful for you, the player. In the second act, this map is taken away from you. While it's not necessarily the end of the world, it (in my opinion) made navigation a slog. Let's say this was a narrative choice, with Elster not having any records of the area, thus not having a map.<br>
        So, why isn't it within Elster's capabilities to... build one? I could draw one out myself with pen and paper, but isn't it just nicer for the game to at least show me a partial map, with the areas I've visited, rather than just saying "screw you, no map for you"?<br>
        Going in loops, I found myself just sticking to the right hand rule (maze-solving algorithm) and seeing if I had business or things to do in any particular room. As new paths opened, it became a little bit harder to navigate around. I'd think, "oh, I can't go there right now", or "I'm missing an item here", only for the item to already have been "given" to me, I just can't fit it in the six inventory slots I'd have.<br>
        It was a little annoying to have to backtrack to an item box because my shotgun is stopping me from grabbing a key item needed to solve a particular puzzle. It's one of those things Signalis got from Resident Evil. While I say it's annoying, I actually praise it. It made me very conscious of what I was carrying, the resources I'd be okay parting with, etc.<br>
        <br>
        While I'm not going to go very in-depth with respect to the narrative, it's done in a way that leaves a lot of questions and hunger for more. You get most of your lore / worldbuilding from documents, like in Resident Evil, as well as various cutscenes. There's quite a few cryptic elements to the game. It's not necessarily "open-ended", but definitely leans into more ambiguity while telling you just about enough to let you piece it together.<br>
        I'm not usually a fan of this type of narrative ending. Something like FF16's ending was ambiguous, and I wasn't really the biggest fan of it- but that's because the entire narrative, up until that point, was decently straightforward. With Signalis, you have an ambiguous ending to a game that's constantly giving you breadcrumbs, that fits the overall narrative style. I can deduce what happens, or theorize, and that'd just be an extension of what has happened thus far.<br>
        The characters were really, really interesting, and them being used sparingly as you explore gave a certain weight whenever they'd pop up. Once again, this is kinda reminiscent of something like, Silent Hill 2, where your encounters with Angela, Eddie, Laura (and to a lesser extent Maria) were short, but meaningful.<br>
        <br>
        Combat isn't really the biggest thing in Signalis, since, once again, "pick your battles" (aside from bosses, but they were mostly straightforward). But you're mostly just aiming a gun with a laser sight and shooting enemies (who you feel more sorry for than anything). You also have the option of burning them to prevent them from reanimating, which made exploration (especially backtracking through common areas) a little easier.<br> 
        <br>
        Coming from freshly playing Resident Evil 3 and 4 remakes, Signalis was a really great breath of fresh air in the survival horror genre. Even if it makes a couple decisions that, as a player, are a tiny bit frustrating (like the map or the inventory limit), they achieve something that survival horror NEEDS to thrive in: making the player feel helpless. This, combined with its stylistic choices and ambiguous, but "deduce-able" narrative, probably make it my favorite survival horror game I've played.<br>
        Overall... I really liked the game with the space robot lesbians.<br>
