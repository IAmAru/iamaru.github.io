      <h2>1game1week - Week 5 (1/30/25) - Shadows of the Damned - Hella Remastered</h2>
      <p>Hi again everyone! It's week 5! (1/29 -> 2/5) <br>
        I ended up "borrowing" a GPU from a server/NAS machine that doesn't need it. I'm still sad :(<br>
        With that said, as of this week we're just shy of 10% (5/52) done with this challenge, and just about over 20% of the games I beat in 2022 at 5/24, last time I did 1g1w.<br>
        <br>
        New games from 1/22 -> 1/28:<br>
        <br>
        Plumbers Don't Wear Ties (PS5) (1/22)<br>
        Song of Saya (PC) (1/24)<br>
        Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE Plus (PS5) (1/27)<br>
        Atelier Firis ~ The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey (1/27)<br>
        <br>
        Currently, my backlog (https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_) is at +4.<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered<br>
        PLATFORM: PlayStation 5<br>
        STARTED ON: 1/20<br>
        BEATEN ON: 1/20<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 10 hours<br>
        <br>
        Super fun!<br>
        Only took a day over the weekend to knock this one out. I'm really glad I picked it up from VGP recently. I skipped on it during its initial LRG print.<br>
        I don't know if I want to call it short... You know, 10 hours for one casual run is a good chunk of game. It reminded me a lot of Resident Evil 4. In fact, I joked about this with a friend and he said he thought the exact same thing.<br>
        The gameplay, the puzzle-solving, the whole chasing a blonde girl into a terrifying place bit... Wonder if there's any overlap there. <br>
        Even still, it manages to have enough unique quirks to set itself apart, including really over the top absurd humor and charming one liners such as "taste my big boner", or the great exchange of "hard men like us don't mix", with the reply of "was that a come on?". I'm definitely a fan. Just random ass humor undermining the setting. It's one of those creative games from a collaboration Suda51 and Shinji Mikami (probably where the Resi4 comes from). Soundtrack by Akira Yamaoka.<br>

        Currently still reading through Higurashi When They Cry: Himatsubushi on Steam Deck. Had to derail a lot for the past little while... that'll be next week's post though!<br>
        As always, please feel free to shoot me a message to recommend your favorite game. I'd love to hear what you guys have to recommend.<br>
        <br>
        See you next week!
