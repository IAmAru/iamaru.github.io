      <h2>1game1week - Week 22 (5/29/25) - Guitar Hero: World Tour</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 22! (5/28 -> 6/4)<br>
        I forgot to make a post yesterday... whoops.<br>
        Well... it's probably okay. I feel a bit sad because I want to be consistent with this but I'll live anyway.<br>
        <br>
        Life stuff... Oh! I bought a new camera. That's cool right? And I fixed a big problem with my 3D printer. I'm livin the life.<br>
        Went on a trip to a nearby city recently and it was really fun. It was my first time going. One of my coworkers' band was playing at a restaurant / bar so I went and saw him. Had a few drinks, had fun in the city. Win win I'd say.<br>
        Also, I made a post about a mod I did on a SCART switch to get serial data off of it using an Arduino Nano. <a href="https://hoshikawa-aru.com/pages/blog_posts/52525_otakugames_donutdongle.html">You can see the post here. </a>I had a lot of fun with it! I'll be editing it soonish to include a way to convert it from push-pull serial to open-drain. Makes things a bit nicer.<br>
        Anyways!<br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +12 (lower is better, +0 from last week).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Guitar Hero: World Tour<br>
        PLATFORM: Xbox 360<br>
        STARTED ON: 4/17<br>
        BEATEN ON: 4/25<br>
        <br>
        I'm not gonna sit here and have anyone say 'that's just Guitar Hero, it doesn't count!'. No. I didn't spend 8 hours in that game for you to think that. I did my time with the plastic guitar.<br>
        This actually had a really decent setlist and fun charting, so I was glad I played it.<br>
        I've also added a few of the songs to the playlist I typically listen to so... nice!<br>
        To be honest, I started playing this because after Chapter 7 of Higurashi my brain was so fried I wanted to just feel something. Do something brainless. Does that make sense?<br>
        It really just felt like, "move my fingers while listening to music", rather than "playing Guitar Hero". I think the plastic guitar has been ingrained so deep into my brain that it just feels natural.<br>
        For fun, I picked up my actual guitar. I was nowhere near as good as with plastic, but it was really fun to play nonetheless.<br>
        During 2020-2021, I was really big into Clone Hero. It's probably just where I picked up how to actually be decent at playing plastic guitars... I wouldn't say good or great by any means, but definitely good enough to get through the games and snag a few FCs.<br>
