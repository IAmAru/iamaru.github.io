      <h2>1game1week - Week 25 (6/18/25) - Space Channel 5 Special Edition</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 25! (6/18 -> 6/25)<br>
        First time in a little while I actually post on a Wednesday.<br>
        Bought a flip phone today. I'm trying to dumb down (lol) my life. It probably sounds weird but I think having a computer following me around every second of the day has made me miserable for years.<br>
        Doom scrolling, checking notifications, YouTube shorts, seeing if I've had anything come up... Isn't it just too much? It's better when I can just sit at my computer and then break away whenever I want without being chased by another one that constantly demands my attention.<br>
        I feel as if I've forgotten what being bored feels like, since I have a near-endless amount of entertainment at my fingertips, every second of the day. I've lost sight of the real world because I've substituted it with a digital world, a long time ago.<br>
        This blog was originally made for me to have a window open and let out my thoughts / let people know I'm still alive while hiding under a rock and leaving social media forever. Who knows? Maybe that day is closer than I think.<br>
        Even then, who am I to denounce smartphones, with all the neat things they provide nowadays? High-resolution cameras, music streaming, GPS systems, multifactor applications... I'll have to find ways of getting around these.<br>
        Who knows? If I end up actually following through with not using my smartphone I might just make another post with my experience.<br>
        Do I sound like a hipster yet? Or have I awoken something? Ha.<br>
        Jokes aside... I'm keeping it as a trial basis, just to see how I fare without my iPhone. Maybe I'll take up yet another hobby.<br>
        Actually, I'm decently behind on my normal gaming hobby. I've been soldering nonstop for a little while. Picked up a bug for it and I'm having a lot of fun.<br>
        Speaking of which, I have an update for the post I made a couple weeks back for the OtakuGames SCART switch. I ended up designing a PCB myself and soldering to the Arduino Nano. I'll have a post about it soon, I really had a lot of fun with it. In the meantime, some of the documentation in <a href="https://github.com/svirant/RT4k_HD15_serial_control/tree/main/Otaku%20Games%20Scart%20Switch">this link</a> was written by me. Even if you don't get what's going on, I just wanted to highlight it!<br>
        <br>
        Oh! Next week we're hitting halfway through the year. Time's flown by!<br>
        I'm planning on doing a slightly more detailed post with stats on what I've played up to this point, even the games I decided not to include in 1g1w. This includes genres and series and stuff so I can see what I'm trending to. I know top 1 played franchise so far this year is Higurashi. Top 1 genre is probably visual novel (also due to Higurashi).<br>
        Who knows? Maybe I'll also rank the games based on how I feel about them so far.<br>
        I really would like to get some analytics on what I'm enjoying and playing through this year. See what I'm playing too much (VNs), see what I should play more, see average length of the games I'm playing...<br>
        Anyways!<br>

        <br>
        New games from 6/11 -> 6/17:<br>
        <br>
        None! This is the second time this month.<br>
        <br>
        <hr>
        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +13 (lower is better, +0 from last week).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Space Channel 5 Special Edition (1 and 2)<br>
        PLATFORM: PlayStation 2<br>
        STARTED ON: 5/4<br>
        BEATEN ON: 5/4<br>
        <br>
        Man, these games are fun.<br>
        Pretty strict on timing though. Maybe I just suck?<br>
        Played the first game on Dreamcast last year, and really wanted to give 2 a try. Even if it's essentially more of the same, it's really fun.<br>
        I ended up playing both games, as I figured they're both decently short and wouldn't feel quite right in just saying "well I played 2 but not 1 so it doesn't count" etc.<br>
        There's a huge charm to arcade-ey games. When you're not relying on a huge overarching narrative, it's great seeing games that turn up the "this game is fun" aspect to 11 without falling back on "but the story though...".<br>
        Even for a more arcade-ey experience, even the narrative is fun and quirky. I daresay characters are interesting and I still remember how hard I laughed at hearing "They got Space Michael!" for the first time.<br>
        Some folks reading this know already, but I wasn't really a Sega consoles guy growing up, so I missed out on experiences like this for a long, long time.<br>
        Doesn't it have such an interesting aesthetic too? This is a pre-turn-of-the-century game so it's heavily going for that futuristic space-ey look we all fell in love with when we had whimsy in our hearts.<br>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rzy7D4RWLY&ab_channel=Ulala%27sCosmicAttack">There was even an MTV show planned for Ulala! Ended up going nowhere unfortunately... I think this video in particular was lost media for a while.</a><br>
        Gosh, I'm not even mentioning the music. It's probably the most important part of this game. Space Channel 5 has such an incredibly banging soundtrack. I'm listening to it as I'm typing and it's taking all my might not to just stop and vibe to the music.<br>
        <br>        
        There isn't a lot left to say about Space Channel 5 from me. It's a really fun game and its quirky narrative and aesthetic make it pop out a lot. Going for full clears while listening to groovy music made the experience great. Maybe this game made me realize anything I play after this will pale in comparison and that's why I haven't beaten much since... ha!<br>
        I suffered a bit with input delay. I read online that pretty much everyone suffered from input delay (either that or we all suck). I played on an HDMI-modded system (digital->digital). In theory I was only getting 4ms or so of lag which... well that's 0.004 of a second so can't quite be that.<br>
        For a while, I was playing with a Bluetooth controller (another PS2 mod), but ended up switching out for a wired pad to eliminate as many variables as I could. I did a bit better... until I didn't, but hey, that's life!<br>
