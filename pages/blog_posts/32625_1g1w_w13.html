      <h2>1game1week - Week 13 (3/26/25) - Song of Saya</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 13! (3/26 -> 4/2)<br>
        This time, we're having a great week. That's because since we're in Week 13, we are officially 25% done with the challenge. Thanks for sticking around! The year is only just beginning, so there's still a bunch of time to play more games.<br>
        Knocking on wood here, but there's no new games I'm really looking forward to purchasing for the next little while. So hopefully I can take a nice chill pill and just play without adding to the counter!<br>

        <br>
        New games from 3/19 -> 3/25:<br>
        <br>
        * Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition (Switch)<br>
        * Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land (PS5)<br>
        <br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +16 (lower is better).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Song of Saya (PC)<br>
        PLATFORM: PC<br>
        STARTED ON: 3/3<br>
        BEATEN ON: 3/4<br>
        <br>
        I'm not quite sure if I can even say much about the game. It's a really short experience that's definitely not for most people.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sitting here typing this out, I'm actually wondering if there's anything I can even say without spoiling the entire novel. Don't think I can really recommend it due to its nature and imagery, but if you're interested, the narrative is incredibly engaging.<br>
        It's like... Breaking Bad, in a sense. Well, now I don't really wanna spoil Breaking Bad.<br>
        There's a shift in the protagonists' morals that makes the entire novel very interesting by about the halfway point.<br>
        The novel is really short with a few endings, I believe I clocked in somewhere around 6 or 7 hours.<br>
        <br>
        Funnily enough, I picked this up off Facebook Marketplace. A lady was selling codes for the game for incredibly cheap. I'm assuming she got from a Saya fumo order... who knows, really lol.<br>
        This is one of the two digital game purchases I've made this year thus far (although it was technically secondhand).<br>
        My first instinct when playing a PC game these days is to try to run it on Steam Deck. Unfortunately it looked like this just wasn't going to work on Deck, unfortunately. The Deck is so nice for visual novels... I missed it when reading this.<br>
        I try to attach a picture with every post, but since this was a digital game and I couldn't even play it on the Deck, I'll end off this post without one.<br>
        <br>
        Typically, this section is reserved for me to talk about more games or stuff I'm doing. I platinum'd Atelier Yumia today. It's an alright game. I was a bit disappointed. I'll probably reserve from talking more about it until its 1g1w entry (one month from now lol).<br>
        Since I'm done, I'm actually reading through the next Higurashi chapter, Tsumihoroboshi. This series has me on a chokehold. It's so interesting. I know it's not the subject of this entry, but my goodness, please get yourself into Higurashi. Chapter 1 is free on Steam. THAT is a VN I'd recommend! :)<br>
        <br>
        That's all for now. See you next week!
