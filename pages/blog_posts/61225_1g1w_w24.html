      <h2>1game1week - Week 24 (6/11/25) - Higurashi When They Cry: Chapter 8 - Matsuribayashi</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 24! (6/4 -> 6/11)<br>
        Sorry... I streamed yesterday and it completely slipped my mind to post.<br>
        I was actually streaming today as well. But it looks like Twitch didn't want me to stream, or something, because my bitrate went down catastrophically and I was dropping 70-80% of my frames. I'll just stream another day...<br>
        A week since Switch 2 released, huh? Have any of you guys gotten your hands on it? Are we having fun?<br>
        I've mostly done backwards compatibility things. I really hope some of these titles get an update.<br>
        Hmm... Even trying to wrap my head around all this, I'm really struggling to come up with things to say. I've had a little to drink tonight, so that might be blanking my mind a bit.<br>
        <br>
        I've been working on some fun projects recently. I've had a Sega Neptune board on my workbench for a while. The interactive bill of materials tells me I'm ~70% done with placing things.<br>
        Had a few Donut Dongles being built as well.<br>
        A recent blog post of mine also outlined a method for sniffing out the active port on an OtakuGames SCART Switch and feeing it to a Donut Dongle. The current type of serial comms being output is push/pull, and I was going to just say "I'll solder in a buffer"... but then I was asked, "why not just design a PCB?"...<br>
        I thought... yeah... why not?<br>
        Ended up designing two different PCBs, one better than the other, to convert serial from push/pull to Open Drain. I received the not-so-good one recently, and it works like a charm. They both do the same thing, it's just a different form factor, so I'm really hopeful that the better ones that are coming soon will work just as well.<br>
        That whole process will likely become a blog post on its own or an edit to <a href="https://hoshikawa-aru.com/pages/blog_posts/52525_otakugames_donutdongle.html">the post outlining the process of modding the OtakuGames switch</a>, so probably not the venue for that one here.<br>
        Anyways!<br>

        New games from 6/4 -> 6/10:<br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +13 (lower is better, +0 from last week).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Higurashi When They Cry: Chapter 8 - Matsuribayashi<br>
        PLATFORM: PC (Steam Deck)<br>

        BEATEN ON: 5/1<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 29 hours<br>
        <br>
        There really is something special about this series.<br>
        To pin it down... it'd be a little difficult, but there really is something special.<br>
        I started reading Higurashi earnestly two years ago: I finished Chapter 1, Onikakushi, on April 6th, 2023, while sitting on my friend Billy's couch. It really took me a while to get to it.<br>
        If any of you are unaware, Higurashi is a sound novel / visual novel where for some reason (I'm still trying really keenly to not spoil anything), the characters go insane and do bad things. It's essentially a murder/mystery narrative where your objective is putting the pieces together before they are explained to you.<br>
        Most chapters start with a slice-of-life portion where the overall mystery is not being added to. While you have some good interactions, it really boils down to the characters just being kids playing around.<br>
        It almost made me feel guilty. Every single time, it would've just been nice to keep them in stasis like that. "Nothing happened after [that slice of life portion], and they all lived happily ever after". But isn't that more so running away?<br>
        Even before reading, knowing there's eight chapters made me dread continuing something like Tatarigoroshi (Week 1 of this year), because I knew those peaceful slice of life days would be over. But was that really worth it? Rip them out of their fun lives and thrust them into the narrative's main plight?<br>
        Sure, it sounds silly... I even feel a little silly typing this all out. But it's how I felt!<br>
        <br>
        Even if I've tried my best this whole time to not spoil anything, I'll at least say that Matsuribayashi is a happy ending to the series. There's a bit more Higurashi to go, and it makes me feel guilty. Like I said, it's weird. Who am I to take away from that happy ending? The whole time through eight long chapters, these characters fight to get their fun lives back. These slice-of-life sections are crucial. They show you what they're fighting for. Even when they finally got their reward... how can I just rip it away from them?<br>
        Through all of that, it's reassuring to know that there's a happy end at the end of the tunnel, even if it takes eight chapters.<br>
        <br>
        I'm really happy I was bullied into reading Higurashi. It's one of those life-changing works.<br>
        There was actually a time, a long, long time back where I would've been in the path of getting into Ryukishi07's works. Back in senior year of high school, I fancied this one nerdy girl whose name I don't even remember anymore.<br>
        One day, I saw her in forensics class reading Danganronpa 2 via YouTube video on her phone. To make conversation, since I'd read Danganronpa, I asked what her favorite anime was. She said, with no hesitation, "Umineko When They Cry".<br>
        This all happened, probably a decade ago. So my memory's a bit fuzzy. I remember trying to watch the anime. I believe it was either she told me or I saw online to read the visual novel instead. So... during a Steam Sale in very early 2017, I bit the bullet and bought the Question Arcs for Umineko.<br>
        Never really got around to reading it, and that one girl and I ended up not really talking all that much after that. But... it's nice that I'm right there, itching to start reading this new mystery.<br>
        Most people recommend reading Higurashi before ever even thinking of reading Umineko. If that girl had read Higurashi as well, and preferred Umineko, I wonder if I will too?<br>
        Still...<br>
        I wish I had given all of this a read back in 2017. That'd be a whole decade of 07th I'd have already done and dusted, with more opportunity to let it stew.<br>
        Who knows? Maybe life would've been different. Ha!<br>
        This will probably be my last post this year regarding the Higurashi series. As much as I love it, and will very likely continue reading it, I don't think it would be very beneficial to allow myself to count it for 1g1w.<br>
        We are in Week 24, and there have been six posts with Higurashi for Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and now 8. This means 25% of all posts this year have been regarding Higurashi.<br>
        Let this be a soft kick in the butt for me to hurry up and start getting some variety in here.<br>
