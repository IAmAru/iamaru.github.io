      <h2>1game1week - Week 46 (11/15/25) - Lollipop Chainsaw</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 46! (11/12 -> 11/19)<br>
        Sorry for the late post. Been a little bit busy.<br>
        Actually, just this past Thursday was my birthday. Yesterday was my dog's birthday, so it was a double celebration. It's just small things though, really. Just a nice little dinner on Thursday with my family and some Tres Leches cake.<br>
        I don't like calling attention to the day much because it's not like it's meant a lot to me anymore after I turned 21 or so. With that said, thank you to all my friends and family members who sent over a message. It means a lot.<br>
        <br>
        You know, this whole backlog clearing exercise has made me a little averse to buying new things. On Thursday, the company I work for slipped me a $25 credit to any gift card I want. A year or two ago, I would've thought, "Oh, let me go buy a new game with that."<br>
        But now... now I'm weighing pros and cons. Whether or not I'll play it anytime soon. Whether or not I'll be able to commit the playtime to it. Whether or not I want to inflate the yearly new game count / have them sit there for a while.<br>
        I think I'll probably use the gift card to buy games anyways (specifically some PS1 Classics on PS3 Digital that are really expensive physically), but I found the hesitation really funny. It's good, I mean, this is what I wanted!<br>
        <br>
        Just a few more weeks to go. I'd really like to end the year with a negative backlog count (more beaten games than purchased). We shall see how it all turns out.<br>
        <br>
        Anyways!<br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +6 (lower is better, -1 from last week).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Lollipop Chainsaw<br>
        PLATFORM: Xbox 360<br>
        GENRE: Hack and Slash<br>
        STARTED ON: 11/5<br>
        BEATEN ON: 11/10<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 5 hours and 50 minutes (I used a stopwatch on my phone lol)<br>
        <br>
        This week, I played the original version of Lollipop Chainsaw on Xbox 360.<br>
        It's a decently short game, which got it a lot of annoyed people back when it released, and when the remake, RePOP, released. That's not quite the only thing that got RePOP in controversy but I played the original either way, so RePOP doesn't really matter to me.<br>
        Lollipop Chainsaw's biggest strength, in my opinion, is its writing. It's a terrible B-movie on purpose with incredibly out-of-the-blue lines that just want you to get a laugh from the ridiculousness. It's probably James Gunn's best work.<br>
        Hearing zombies / rescued students say stupid stuff like, "Girls in Kenya have big butts" or "I regret those three bukkake videos" or "I never thought I'd be saved by someone with such huge tits" always got a laugh out of me. Somehow, they managed to find a way to make the next comment more ridiculous than the last.<br>
        <br>
        The story itself is really entertaining. I think some of the side characters could've been fleshed out just a little more, but they were mostly meant to serve as one-note characters for gags. I think the only one who wasn't more jokey than anything was probably Cordelia.<br>
        Rosalind and Juliet's dad were great. Rosalind being a total 2008 middle school scene girl somehow made me feel really nostalgic for the aesthetic (as over-the-top as it is these days).<br>
        Juliet and Nick had a funny dynamic. It's a straight man / funny man dynamic, with Nick mostly serving as the straight man.<br>

        <br>
        It also has a great soundtrack, including but not limited to various licensed tracks from artists like Toni Basil, Dragonforce, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, as well as bangers composed by Akira Yamaoka.<br>
        <br>
        To boot, the game just so happens to be fun- but ultimately brainless- hack-and-slash action. It's not necessarily special or groundbreaking. You go around, kill zombies in a place where you're not allowed to move on until you've killed enough, go to another place, kill more zombies, fight a boss, go to the next stage. No single enemy is too much of a threat or forces you to adapt or change the way you play.<br>
        When turning off your brain and just letting the fun writing be the foreground to the gameplay background, it's a lot of fun. It comes back to what I said before- it's a B-movie on purpose. So, it really just feels like hanging out listening to some of your friends' terrible jokes while watching a bad movie together. Somehow, though, the movie's making fun of itself as much as you and your friends are making fun of it.<br>
