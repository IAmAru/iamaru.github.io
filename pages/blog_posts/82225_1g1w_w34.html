      <h2>1game1week - Week 34 (8/22/25) - No More Heroes</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 34! (8/20 -> 8/27)<br>
        Been a busy week. Not really a lot of fun random lore to share...<br>
        Only really thing is that given my recent rant on things being stupid expensive, I'm going to try to stop buying things completely, avoid takeout, etc. A few friends know, but I'm planning to go to Japan next year and I'd really love to have a big budget for it... so saving here is imperative.<br>
        I'm also slowly closing in on student loans, which is convenient because forebearance ended so interest is accruing. As of today, I'm somewhere around 6.4K ish for student loans. It doesn't look too unmanageable knowing that I started at 22Kish almost four years ago, but it's still a pretty big bill.<br>
        Wish me luck. I'll probably need it.<br>
        <br>
        Anyways!<br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +13 (lower is better, +0 from last week).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: No More Heroes<br>
        PLATFORM: Wii<br>
        GENRE: Action<br>
        STARTED ON: 6/26<br>
        BEATEN ON: 8/14<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 12 hours and 15 minutes (tracked via in-game timer)<br>
        <br>
        I do realize that I might be screwing myself from enjoying this game to its fullest, lorewise, by not first going out and playing games from the Kill the Past series (Silver Case / 25th Ward etc). I bought NMH back in 2017, and I decided even without all the knowledge of KTP, NMH seemed decently self-contained for me to just be able to go in and enjoy it without needing to have all the Kill the Past lore.<br>
        While I do think I was right... I probably would actually have enjoyed knowing a little more of the lore. To my untrained eyes, No More Heroes didn't really seem to have much of a narrative outside its gameplay loop. You go on an assassination mission, meet an eccentric character, kill them, do random odd-jobs that are designed to be a little obtuse / less interesting, and... that's kind of it.<br>
        <br>
        Going around Santa Destroy during the in-between sections of the missions was designed to be tedious to (again, to my untrained eyes) highlight the assassination missions / rank up / whatever as something Travis cares about. Everything else is just forgettable white noise. Pick up cocounts, find lost cats, mow lawns...<br>
        The rank-up missions / assassination missions, though... those were really, really fun. Combat was really interesting to navigate, although... I get the feeling I didn't really get into the knitty gritty of it. When fighting for rank #2 (with a character that's apparently very interesting Kill The Past-lore wise), I found out that even when blocking, you can dodge and put things into slowmo, which opened a whole can of worms for me.<br>
        Here I was, very late in the game, barely figuring out the combat system. This particular boss had me trying various... various... different times to beat her, so the game definitely was punishing me for my ignorance. To be fair to myself, the game just kind of infodumps everything at the very very beginning. I wasn't even aware until I saw a YouTube tutorial (less so to see what I was doing wrong and more so to see if I really had to whiff punish everything for a long time until she died).<br>
        <br>
        I definitely feel like I missed out with the characters, especially the ones in the rank-up missions. Wanting to learn more about particular people instead of just thinking "well that guy's dead now". There's a whole bunch of stuff apart from the main narrative of Travis killing people trying to get laid going on behind the curtains that I feel I robbed myself out of.<br>
        It's probably not going to be anytime soon, but I 100% want to come back to No More Heroes, on Switch, after getting some more work done to check out Kill the Past. I already have every game I need except Flower Sun and Rain (pain in the ass to get, pretty expensive). Actually, I also played Killer7 back a few years ago. Everything kind of had me with the same train of thought of "I'm missing a lot here".<br>
        Just more stuff to play. Thankfully I can knock out another backlog entry if I go back to No More Heroes. I played on Wii this time, so Switch will just be another entry completely.<br>
        Again, though... not right now, maybe someday. I just hope it still has the... shaking motion for recharging the sword batteries.<br>
