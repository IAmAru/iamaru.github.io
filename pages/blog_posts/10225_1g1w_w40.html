      <h2>1game1week - Week 40 (10/2/25) - Cave Story+ and Cave Story 3D</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 40! (10/1 -> 10/8)<br>
        I'm late... Sorry, I forgot last night. I'm a little bit sick as well, so I'll probably keep it brief.<br>
        It's been a little while, but I've been back home since Sunday. It was pretty fun in Vegas, and I learned a lot in my class. I took a lot of videos, so I'll probably be editing and uploading what I call "secret lore". Dunno if I'll really be sharing it outside of family / social circle but I have fun making them.<br>
        Speaking of classes! My second "semester" of Japanese classes starts tomorrow. I'm really excited. 
        <br>
        Anyways!<br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +10 (lower is better, +6 from last week).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Cave Story+ / Cave Story 3D<br>
        PLATFORM: Switch / 3DS<br>
        GENRE: Action Platformer<br>
        STARTED ON: 9/15<br>
        BEATEN ON: 9/16<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 11 hours and 15 minutes / 4 hours and 46 minutes<br>
        <br>
        One of these games is one of the best games, in my opinion, ever made. It is one of the best crafted experiences that has ever graced gaming.<br>
        The other one... is Cave Story 3D.<br>
        I told a friend of mine, that going from Cave Story+, which I played first in this pair, felt like going from a nice, beautiful, hot wife and a penthouse in the Bahamas to a cheap hooker in a crack motel.<br>
        If you've never played Cave Story, please do so. It is, as I said, one of the best ever experiences you'll have in gaming. I've played this game several times on 3DS- not Cave Story 3D, but the digital-only original Cave Story. You may be asking, "what's the difference?"<br>
        Cave Story 3D has a very different visual aesthetic from Cave Story. As you may guess, this includes 3D elements, including its backgrounds, its characters, etc. When the original Cave Story was 2D, you're having to adapt how maps scroll, the way characters need to interact with the environment, how the player sees things, etc.<br>
        One of the unfortunate things about this transition is that the game consumes far more resources in 3D than 2D. This causes the game, which was originally intended to be a smooth-running platformer, to top out at 30fps and drop frames consistently. It's a worse experience overall: motion is less clear, and game is less responsive.<br>
        The latter is the one that matters most here, since you're playing a game that constantly requires you to respond to enemies and move around its environment. I have a hacked 3DS, one thing I could do was to force my (new) 3DS run at (new) 3DS clock speeds, rather than regular 3DS clock speeds.<br>
        For those who don't know, you can do so! Higher clock speeds are available on (new) 3DS systems for games like Smash 3DS, Xenoblade 3D, Sun and Moon, etc. Most games don't request them... because they didn't exist yet. With a hacked 3DS, however, you can force games to run at the higher clock speeds for both GPU and CPU. Even then, though, it was weirdly enough still not all that great (although the upgrade is noticeable).<br>
        Also... there's a really big charm to the 2D sprites that gets lost here. There is a "classic mode", that put the 2D sprites in the 3D environment, but it's really not the same.<br>
        <br>
        Compare it to Cave Story+, on the Switch (or even just Cave Story Original on 3DS). Snappy 60 frames that allow you to properly engage yourself in the games' fights and have the game properly respond to your input, full 2D visuals...<br>
        I really have no notes for Cave Story+. It is the complete version of one of the most quintessential experiences in gaming. Its story is always a treat to read, and it's always accompanied by its great cast.<br>
        The only thing for me, in this particular playthrough, is that I messed up the requirements for the True Ending about midway through the game (if you know, I forgot to drain the water in the Waterway Cabin), so I had to restart it. It wasn't all too bad, I always enjoy playing this game so going back to the beginning didn't phase me all that much.<br>
        Also... turns out, I actually had already finished Cave Story+ on Switch back in 2017. I totally forgot about it... and didn't mark it as such in my Backloggery. Turns out, I just beat it this time for nothing (other than entertainment in revisiting one of my favorite games of all time).<br>
        Finding that out made me play 3D, since I also owned it and I had the structure of the game in my brain already. I finished out the True Ending in both.<br>
