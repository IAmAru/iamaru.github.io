      <h2>1game1week - Week 15 (4/9/25) - Higurashi When They Cry: Chapter 5 - Meakashi</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 15! (4/9 -> 4/16)<br>
        I'm really not liking where the Switch 2 situation is heading...<br>
        In other news, my 401k has dropped around $5k in the last week so I'm big chillin :) (I'm cooked).<br> 
        Hopefully everyone's been doing okay, regardless of what's been going on in the outside world. It's nicer to tune things out and let them play out. Sometimes, as an individual, things can seem overwhelming... what's the point in focusing on them, and being sad?<br>
        Maybe it's wrong to turn a blind eye... Can anyone really do anything, as individuals, though?<br>
        Well. Life will carry on. You and I will still be forced to wake up in the morning and see the sun rise. Regardless of what's happening. As long as the sun is still in the sky... everything will be alright, right?<br>
        <br>
        Let's celebrate the good things in life and combat the bad parts later.<br>
        Like...<br>

        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +17 (lower is better).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>

        This is the third Higurashi chapter I've finished this year. It's funny looking back. It really feels as if I've been sucked into the story, starting from Tatarigoroshi (Ch3).<br>
        As a couple days back, I've actually already finished Chapter 6, Tsumihoroboshi, so please look forward to the Week 18 post, lol.<br>
        I don't think I could forgive myself if I talked about this too much, and spoiled someone who could possibly get into Higurashi, as slim of a possibility as that is, with my heavily limited audience (thank you very much for reading my posts!).<br>
        <br>
        As such, I'm not going to talk about my thoughts, or the pieces I've put together, or how right or otherwise I am about the mysteries of Hinamizawa. I've shared a lot of thoughts with my friends who have actually finished, so at least they're documented... somewhere.<br>
        When I finished Meakashi, I figured I was starting to put most of the pieces together. It's a big puzzle. It's a fun game. The actual visual novel part may not be too much of a game, but the thinking part definitely is.<br>
        It's a social game. Sure, the "gameplay", strictly speaking, is just pressing the A button. Occasionally the left bumper if I want to set it to Auto Mode. The real fun starts with theorizing- with talking to other people experiencing the novel alongside you, or people who already know the answers.<br>
        <br>
        I didn't mention it last time, but I was actually in a post-chapter discussion with my friends razorthecurse and Billy for Ch4, Himatsubushi:<br>

        It's a bit unfortunate but it seems like the audio for Billy and I is really low, so it's a bit hard to follow. In any case, thought it'd be cool to share.<br>
        <br>
        That's all for now. See you all next week! Stay safe!
