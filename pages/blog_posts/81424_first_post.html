      <h2>My first post (8/14/24)</h2>
      <p>Hello, and thanks for reading!<br>
        I go by Aru. I've recently decided to heavily limit social media use. However, I'm a big fan of sharing my interests. It's the reason I used social media!<br>
        As such, I will try to post here whenever I do something I'd like to share. I've taken an HTML template from an online source and am starting to modify it to my needs. I'm not proficient with HTML though, so hopefully I don't screw up too much.<br><br>

        As for myself... I'm 25, and like to do things related to videogames. Particularly, console modifications. I'm pretty decent with a soldering iron!<br>
        I work 9-5 as a cybersecurity professional. I have been in the field for three or so years, and I think it's really fun!<br>
        I will very likely not post much outside of hobby work in an effort to maintain myself relatively anonymous.<br><br>

        Soon, I will be making a post about using <a href="https://sector.sunthar.com/guides/crt-rgb-mod/sony-aa-1.html">Sunthar's RGB Mux kit</a> to modify a CRT I bought back in 2014 into outputting RGB, as it's my most recent project.<br>
        You'll be able to find my posts under the Blog section in the left-side bar.<br>

        Thanks for reading! If you need to contact me for any reason, please feel free to email me at aru@hoshikawa-aru.com.<br>

        One last thing... please check out my friend Billy's doujinsoft archive <a href="https://btuberbilly.github.io/doujinarchive/">here</a>, and my friend Jin's online shop <a href="https://yuxine.bigcartel.com">here.</a>
