      <h2>1game1week - Week 10 (3/2/25) - Sin and Punishment</h2>
      <p>It's not quite Week 10, but I'm going to be a bit busy this upcoming week and I have some free time now. So... let's pretend it's week 10! (3/5 -> 3/12)<br>
        I'm happy to have been able to keep this up for this long. If we round up a little, we're just shy of 20% of our way to the goal. (19.23%)<br>
        Since we're looking at it with that lens, we're almost through 20% with the year. Time flies when you're having fun.<br>
        I've received a few comments from friends saying they've enjoyed seeing the posts. I think I said it last post, but thank you guys for accompanying me. This is just me screaming into the ether, really.<br>
        I hope that next year I get to read other peoples' posts as well!<br>
        With that said, let's get into the games:
        <hr>
        New games from 2/26 -> 3/4:<br>
        I'm cheating a bit here since it's in the future... Indulge me :)<br>

        * Persona 3 Portable (Xbox Series X)<br>

        <hr>
        Currently, my backlog (https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_) is at +9 (lower is better).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Sin and Punishment<br>
        PLATFORM: Wii U via Virtual Console<br>
        STARTED ON: 2/19<br>
        BEATEN ON: 2/19<br>
        TOTAL PLAYTIME: 3 hours 58 minutes<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I don't think I could tell you anything that was going on with this game at any point in time. I kinda just went along with it.<br>
        <br>
        Another short one.<br>
        One of the other games I bought prior to the eShop closure, if memory serves. I believe this and the Wii VC were the only times it's been released by Nintendo outside Japan.<br>
        That's not to say it's impossible to play on original hardware. All the voices were in English with Japanese subtitles for the original N64 release which is a... curious decision...<br>
        But, with a simple region unlock mod (cutting part of the cartridge tray) for a NA console, it's possible to just buy a Japanese cartridge and play the whole thing, front to back, halfway understanding the plot.<br>
        It's a fun game. I'm not even sure what to call it. On-rails shooter? It's decently short, but these kinds of games are mostly done for replayability's sake. 1cc, etc.<br>
        I might just suck, but the Wii U VC restore points ended up being a major crutch for me as I played. Surely I can go back and end up with a better score down the line, but honestly, I wasn't trying to play this for hours just to get sent back to the beginning.<br>
        Don't care! Easy game easy life!<br>
        <br>
        See you next week!
