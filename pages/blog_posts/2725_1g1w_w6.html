      <h2>1game1week - Week 6 (2/7/25) - Pokemon Brilliant Diamond</h2>
      <p>I know I'm late, but it's still week 6 :') (2/5 -> 2/12) <br>
        The GPU saga is over. I finally got it back :) only took a whole month for the guy to replace the HDMI port.<br>
        <br>
        New games from 1/29 -> 2/4:<br>
        <br>
        Pokemon: Let's Go Pikachu<br>
        <br>
        Currently, my backlog (https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_) is at +4 (lower is better).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Pokemon Brilliant Diamond<br>
        PLATFORM: Nintendo Switch<br>
        STARTED ON: 1/29<br>
        BEATEN ON: 1/30<br>
        <br>
        This was actually my first time playing through Diamond, if you can believe it.<br>
        Wasn't originally planning on doing much of all this, but Pokemon Company decided they'd make a distribution event specifically for people with a completed living dex obtained in BDSP. So... given that I've never beaten Diamond, I decided to give it a whirl. Two for one, right? Knock out a 1g1w entry and knock out a shiny.<br>
        I might be biased just because I really love Sinnoh, but it was surprisingly not too terrible of a game. Just didn't improve much and missed out on Platinum content.<br>
        In the end, it was mostly just for dex completion here, so it wasn't like I was really aiming for much. It did bring me all the way back to 2007. It's kind of crazy. What can I even say now? It's just Diamond.<br>
        There's very interesting difficulty quirks in there that were very fun to work around. The biggest example in my brain is that Cynthia's team is actually fully EV trained with optimal IVs and her AI goes for decently good stategy... the problem is that it's an AI, so it's stil funny to abuse sometimes.<br>
        I did end up getting the Shiny Manaphy. It's pretty.<br>
        <br>
        I'm not currently playing through anything new. Thankfully I've got some time to chill out and play some other things (like Sword/Shield I fear). I'm actually not even sure what I'll be going through next. Maybe I'll finally get myself to play Zone of the Enders.<br>
        As always, please feel free to shoot me a message to recommend your favorite game. I'd love to hear what you guys have to recommend.<br>
        <br>
        See you next week!
