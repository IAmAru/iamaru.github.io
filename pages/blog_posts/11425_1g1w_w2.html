      <h2>1game1week - Week 2 (1/14/25)</h2>
      <p>I know it's been longer than a week since my last post, but it's technically still Week 2 of 2025 so... :)<br>
        Unfortunately I messed up the HDMI port on my PC so it's been a little challenging to just sit down and write.
        <br><br>

        I mentioned it before, but I only really consider a game "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.
        <br><br>

        Currently, my backlog is at +2.
        <br>
        <br>
        GAME: Zone of the Enders (HD Collection)<br>
        PLATFORM: PlayStation 3<br><br>

        A friend of mine recommended this game a lot, since he got a PS2 and used totally legal means to play it, so I figured I'd give it a shot as well.<br><br>

        It was pretty fun. Giant robots in simple objective-based missions, with the interesting mechanic of city damage factoring into mission ranking or score.<br>
        Picked it up a little while back from a retro game shop that's since closed down around April of last year. It was my last purchase there actually :(<br>        
        Kojima game, so it's decently... creative. What I thought was awesome was that the giant robots actually have the same mecha designer as Metal Gear, Yoji Shinkawa.<br>
        ADA (AI companion character) was really annoying to listen to sometimes. It felt like listening to a Twitch chat TTS saying the same lines over and over, as she narrates actions you take, building destruction, etc.<br>
        But... I already know I entered combat! I pressed the button to do it! I know I damaged a building accidentally! It blew up dramatically, so I can tell! Shut up!<br><br>

        Zone of the Enders was actually a decently short game. Maybe a 6-7 hour game, if you wanna do everything. It's pretty enjoyable!<br>
        I can fix Viola btw<br><br>

        Currently, I'm playing Atelier Totori ~ Adventurer of Arland on PS3. I'm decently close to beating it... Atelier games can get hard with time management :') I think this might be the first time I don't get to the true ending in my first run.<br>
        See you next week!
