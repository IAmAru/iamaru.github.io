        Currently, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">backlog</a> is at +16 (lower is better).<br>
        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>
        <br>
        GAME: Atelier Marie ~Alchemist of Salsburg~<br>
        PLATFORM: PlayStation 2<br>
        STARTED ON: 3/1<br>
        BEATEN ON: 3/2<br>
        <br>
        Is this the first PS2 game I'm playing this year? I think so.<br>
        <br>
        Only recently picked up this game from an import site, back in Week 10.<br>
        Thankfully there's a patch available to make a dumped ISO of this game into English for use with a PS2 Homebrew loader, like OPL. So I was able to play the game front to back with no issues!<br>
        A funny thing that stuck out to me is how similar it was to the remake, which I've played before. I guess it's moreso backwards, where the remake is just really similar. It just felt like a normal playthrough. Sure, there's a few quality of life things, but overall... it's pretty much the same thing.<br>
        Classic Atelier is really awesome.<br>
        The ending I wound up getting is the Teacher ending, which is where you're able to make the philosopher's stone.<br>
        <br>
        It's week 12 and by the end of this week, Atelier Yumia will release. I actually scheduled 3 days of PTO for a super long weekend, just to play it (and Xenoblade X).<br>
        Yumia had a demo, which was fun. I'm a bit conflicted though... it seemed like a pretty grandiose adventure, open world, all that stuff. But wasn't the Atelier thing that it's a cozy time management RPG without many real-world consequences?<br>
        I'm probably just looking too deep into it. Classic Atelier is enjoyable and new Atelier is enjoyable, so it's fine. Two cakes!<br>
        <br>
        Right now, I'm reading through Higurashi When They Cry Chapter 5: Meakashi. I was recently in an intense theory-sharing session with a few friends, so it got me really fired up...<br>
        I'm really trying to read as fast as I can, so I can be done before Yumia releases...<br>
        <br>
        That's all for now. See you next week!
