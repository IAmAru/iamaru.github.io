<h2>1game1week - Week 7 (2/28/26) - Valis: The Fantasm Soldier</h2>
Hey all!
I took a much needed staycation this last week. I think I've let myself get burned out a lot on work and it's been affecting me a lot.
Love my job, really. Sometimes all the politicking gets to my head and my own thoughts get to my head. It's been really relaxing though, so I'm happy I took this time off.
Never really take time off, actually. The company I work for caps PTO hours and they're all accrued slowly. I think I get five hours or so every two weeks and it caps out at 220 or so.
I was on route to hit the limit in March, I think... well, now I've got more time to accrue hours so I'll be fine. Actually, I'm gonna start accruing more when I turn 5 with the company so in theory I should probably take more vacations, lol.

Anyways...

<hr>

New games from 2/12 -> 2/18:

None! (Total 6)

<hr>
As of 2/19, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">yearly backlog</a> is at -14 (lower is better, -1 since last week).
And onto 1g1w. A game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game, regardless of how many routes / endings I've achieved.
However, it's preferable to get all endings if possible!

GAME(S): Valis: The Fantasm Soldier
PLATFORM: Sega Genesis
GENRE: Action Platformer
STARTED ON: 2/10
BEATEN ON: 2/11
TOTAL PLAYTIME: 1 hour and 20 minutes (Tracked via Chronometer lol)

I've been meaning to play this one for a while. It's my only Genesis game and I bought it last year to test a job lot of Genesis that I impulse purchased but I never really got around to playing it.
Even for such a short game, it was a ton of fun. I actually wasn't expecting it to be so short, so I knocked it out pretty quickly. It's very much an arcade-ey title.

The story isn't... really all that important. Something about the yin and yang being unbalanced. It's only mentioned in one cutscene in the game, and never really mentioned again.
That particular cutscene was funny. A... deity? of some sort asks our protagonist, Yuko, to fight for the sake of all that is noble and good. Yuko replies, "no! let me go home!", and the deity says "well actually I don't care what you think", and sends you to the next stage.
Story, overall, seemed like mostly an afterthought. I wasn't really interested in this game for its lore or whatever, so it's not... really all that bad to me. I'm decently sure some other people would complain, though.
We're mostly just going from level to level, hitting random mob enemies and going towards screen right until we run into a boss that's oftentimes actually a little easy to beat. Beating a boss lets you unlock one of their abilities. I actually didn't figure this out until I randomly mashed buttons and triggered said ability.
You can get sword upgrades in what I can only really call item boxes in levels. Just about once per level, there's a new sword type to unlock that goes up to level 3. For example, in the first level, you can get an upgrade that shoots a laser, Zelda-style. If you level it up by picking another upgrade, you can shoot... two lasers!
So on and so forth. There's a new one each level... though a couple of them are just "well, this laser's better!". The annoying part is that they're sort of mix and matched throughout stages. So, if you have a good Level 3 sword and accidentally pick up an upgrade for another sword type, you're back to Level 1, which makes things slightly harder for you.
Though... not really like the game's all that hard, so does it really matter?

The OST and art was absolutely beautiful. This was likely the game's best point.
The more I talk the less I feel like I'm communicating that I liked this game. I promise I did! Even if it was easy and didn't really have much of a story, it felt nice to just swing my sword at baddies. I obviously didn't walk away thinking, "wow, that was the best game ever made"... just... "hey that game was enjoyable and I had fun for the hour or so I played."
However... I paid, like, 60 dollars for this. I kinda regret that. It was definitely not worth that.
...At least it was fun?
I should give it a replay, at least to try to make my hour:dollar ratio a little bit nicer, lol.
