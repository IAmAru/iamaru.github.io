<h2>1game1week - Week 4 (2/5/26) - Boneless Zombie</h2>
Hey all! It was Week 4! Like, a week ago! (1/22 -> 1/29)
I halfway have an excuse for this one, at least. I've been incredibly busy studying for a certification exam I had on Wednesday. I passed with a 94! I'm now a GIAC Certified WebApp Pentester, and this makes it my fifth GIAC certification.
I've been studying (read: cramming) almost nonstop for a little while which made me take a step back from writing stuff like this and even playing. In fact, the game I'm talking about today was one I didn't plan on making a 1g1w entry. I just didn't really have an option because I wouldn't have a game per week otherwise.
That's how life is. Hopefully I'll be able to pick up the pace soon. All I really know is that I'm tired. I'll probably start studying for CISSP on my own soon, just for fun. Who knows? Would be nice to have that cert.

Anyways...
<hr>

New games from 1/22 -> 1/28:

None! (Total 4)

<hr>
As of 2/5, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">yearly backlog</a> is at -11 (lower is better, -5 since last week (it's just because I played the RE7 DLCs lol)).
And onto 1g1w. A game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game, regardless of how many routes / endings I've achieved.
However, it's preferable to get all endings if possible!

GAME: Boneless Zombie
PLATFORM: PC
GENRE: 2D Physics Platformer
STARTED ON: 1/10
BEATEN ON: 1/26
TOTAL PLAYTIME: 5 hours and 21 minutes (Tracked via Steam)

Do you guys remember QWOP? It was a game where you controlled a runner's upper and lower legs using the QWOP keys on your keyboard. It was a little distraction that was meant to have you try your best in controlling only certain extremities of your character, individually.
I think some people classified QWOP as kind of like a "rage" game. Sometimes the physics would be weird and difficult to navigate around, so it would cause you to quit or get mad or punch the monitor like a normal person.

Boneless Zombie carries that same spirit. I think.
It features your player character, a (who woulda thunk) boneless zombie in a bunch of various 2D platforming stages. Using the RB and LB buttons on the game controller extends either his legs or his arms for you to go around.
The zombie's limbs can adhere to walls, so you have this weird scenario where you're mostly navigating through stages by sticking to walls or swinging on hooks. You can't walk or navigate normally, though pressing the D pad to the left or right does move you by having your character do some weird cartwheel-looking-like movement. Though, it is mostly used simply for positioning.
At first glance this sounds probably not that bad. There's some interesting level design there and the concept sounds at least a little interesting. But it is a rage game.
It's not really that it's difficult. In fact, that's probably why it's annoying. It's really not difficult. The physics are just legitimately so inconsistent that they're maddening. You could hold the d-pad in a direction a few times after restarting a level and you'd have different results on how your character interacts with the terrain. Or you'd have a random hazard deal damage to you and be thrown into a bunch of other hazards that drain your health and force you to restart.
Or you'd have a swinging section where you have to let go at a very specific time, but it's hard to gauge when to actually let go for a proper trajectory to where you want to go. Or, if you're a completionist: in this game, there are collectible bones scattered through stages. It's probably just nice to think of them like coins from Mario. Anyways, some of these bones would require very careful movement and only give you *one* shot at getting them. If you missed one at the very end of the stage... sorry bucko! Take it from the top!

This is not to say I got rage-baited by a game. I just think the game was annoying and probably should've been cleared in an hour, not five. In fact, that's kinda why I started playing it. I was under the impression it was going to kind of pan out that way. How wrong I was, lol.
It didn't leave me feeling accomplished. Or that I beat a fun game. It just made me think "thank God, I can stop playing this slop now."
If it were me, I think I'd try to make the physics a lot more consistent, but that's just kind of how ragdoll stuff goes.
Was it fun? No. Not even a little bit.
Would I play it again? No. Not even as a bit.
Do I hate it? No. I respect it.
In an age where everything tries to be as appealing for mass consumption, this game dared to do what no one else will. It had a vision. I can dislike the game all I want, but damn it, I gotta respect its commitment to the bit. It set out not to become a mass media franchise, or to become massively marketable, but with a sole purpose: rage-baiting nerds online. And it probably succeeded.
If this was a physical game, I'd put it in a paper shredder, just to make sure it knows its true purpose was fulfilled. You did good, Boneless Zombie. You did good.
