<h2>1game1week - Week 8 (3/1/26) - AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES - nirvanA Initiative</h2>
Hey all! This post was meant to be the last post of February. Still behind and lazy so missed out on that one. That said, we're through with 1/6 of the challenge!
To be completely honest, after last year, I was kind of expecting that I just wouldn't be able to keep it going. I mean, I'm happy I was wrong. Definitely expected to crash, though.
After finishing up the year stats for last year, I just kind of felt a whole weight off my shoulders, so it almost set the expectation for me for this year. This is enjoyable for me though, so it's not like I wanted to go in with a bad mindset for it. Just gotta keep truckin' along and enjoy the ride.
It's sort of why I've just been slacking on posts. Even though it's enjoyable to write, it's more enjoyable to play games or engage with other hobbies too.

Speaking of which, I totally fixed up the Super Famicom I mentioned in the Week 5/6 post. I'd say "I got it for cheap", but knowing all the stuff I've gotten for it, it's probably just about the same investment as a Switch with extra work involved.
I mean, I'll just think about it for a second. I need to pay for the console, pay for new capacitors because the ones in there are 30 years old, pay for a good quality video cable (still waiting on that one, I'm currently using a cheapo SCART cable I had laying around), pay for a quality power supply because OEM ones didn't age well and using cheapo ones is asking for trouble, pay for a flash cart (not necessary but nice for translation patches), pay for a digital audio mod + cable (also not necessary but I like modding), pay for a wireless controller (also not necessary but very neat).
All plus shipping on those things. I'd probably be a little embarassed to see the actual total. It's the fun that counts, though!

Anyways...

New games from 2/19 -> 2/25:

FINAL FANTASY VII (PC) -> Was sort of forced into my Steam library due to owning the 2013 PC version

<hr>
As of 2/26, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/Aru_star_">yearly backlog</a> is at -13 (lower is better, +1 since last week).
And onto 1g1w. A game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game, regardless of how many routes / endings I've achieved.
However, it's preferable to get all endings if possible!

GAME(S): AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES - nirvanA Initiative
PLATFORM: PS4 (on PS5)
GENRE: Adventure Visual Novel
STARTED ON: 2/11
BEATEN ON: 2/19
TOTAL PLAYTIME: 39h35m (Tracked via PS-Timetracker)

In the spirit of No Sleep for Kaname Date coming out for PS5 on the day this post should've been posted (2/26), one of my "goal" games for it was playing Nirvana Initiative. At the time I wasn't aware, but No Sleep for Kaname Date is an "in between" game between AITSF and AINI.
It's kind of cool. I wonder what my thoughts about AINI would've been if I had played NSfKD first?
I mentioned that I took a week off work in the last post. Playing AINI was pretty much all I got up to that week. Made me kind of wonder if I should do that more often. Just say "screw it, I'm taking a week off and doing nothing but gaming."
Not sure if it's good or bad that my boss and coworkers pretty much know that's all I'm up to those days. Either way, it's kind of funny to be predictable like that.

I thoroughly enjoyed AINI, though my heart tells me AITSF is just the better game due to how it lets the player progress through various routes independently, as well as, honestly, the New Cyclops Serial Killings simply being a more interesting case. I played it last year for Week 33 of 1g1w.
The game stars dual protagonists Ryuki, a relatively new member of ABIS, which is a secret section of the police that looks into dreams (paraphrasing), and Mizuki, one of the characters from last game, who grew up and became an agent.
You're taken through a narrative per character. One with Ryuki, "red" route, which is presented as taking place a few months after the first game, and one with Mizuki, "blue" route, which is presented as taking place six years after the "red" route. Both of these aim to solve a series of murder cases called the Half-Body Serial Killings.
The majority of the game is spent interacting with overworld objects and people in various locations, and selecting dialogue options to investigate / learn more. The rest of it is spent in Somnium, which is a sort of digital escape room, for want of a better word.

When I talked about AITSF in 1g1w 2025 Week 33, I mentioned that route progression felt a little bit strange. Essentially, the game would let you get up to a certain point in a route. If you hadn't beaten a pre-requisite route, or the game otherwise deemed you weren't ready for this, it would lock you out.
I said, "if it was me, though, it might not be the worst idea to have locked out the ability to do the branch-splitting decisions up until you'd normally be able to go into that split".
I take it back. It really was the worst idea.

In AINI, the game is a lot more strict about route order. To its defense, it really wants you to follow the events and make sense of things slowly, drip-feeding you information. At the end of non-locked routes, the game gives you a password to enter at branch-splitting decisions.
It's exactly what I wanted, but it unfortunately really takes away from the experience. For example: in my AITSF post, I mentioned that the game would leave you at cliffhangers with a bunch of questions about what's actually going on, leading you to wild theories in your head. "Is X the culprit?! Why did they do that?! What's going on?!" kind of thing. That's pretty much just not present here. To be completely fair to AINI, it makes up for it with its own major narrative twist that you're meant to be piecing together slowly, but nothing hits as hard as casting suspicion on a character based on a cliffhanger and no further info.
All this likely just comes down to taste. I'm happy to just say that I was wrong when I said herding players into specific routes by not allowing them to start other routes was just not to my taste, after actually getting to taste the alternative.

A few of the things I mentioned in the other post still ring true. I still love this cast and the new additions are great. I particularly love Ryuki and Tama's dynamic. Everyone feels incredibly unique, and even though there are a large amount of serious moments in the game, no character is really there to take themselves too seriously.
The writing goes this way, too. You can have relatively less-than-surface-level concepts, like Simulation Theory, or the Allegory of the Cave, or the Butterfly Dream, MKUltra, Project Blue Beam, the Double Slit problem, or Mandela Effect explained to you, and then not two minutes later have another character say a penis joke.
Like I mentioned before, it's probably just taste. I got the feeling like I was just shooting the breeze with a friend, where things can get deep but they're lighthearted enough to not get too dragged down by it. Some may think this diminishes the game's impact and it should just pick whether or not it wants to be serious.

Another thing I touched on was localization not landing well with some jokes. Particularly, wordplay being impossible to accurately translate to English.
In this game, the one that stuck out to me was Mizuki telling Date, "I don't want your old people smell getting on my stuff" / 加齢臭がうつるから嫌なんだよ -> Kareishuu ga utsurukara iyananndayo.
Localized, the reply was "So what if I like oatmeal?!", essentially just snapping back rather than wordplay. In the original script, the reply is おれはインドりょうりがすきですよ！ -> Ore ha Indo ryouri ga suki nandayo! -> "I like Indian food!"
In English, it just doesn't make sense as a joke. In JP, the joke is that Date "misinterprets" Mizuki saying 加齢 (karei, old/aging) for カレー (kare-, curry), which then makes the Indian food reply make a lot more sense.

Unfortunately, this extends, to a certain extent, to puzzle design. Minor puzzle spoilers I suppose:

In a section of the game, you get four pieces of paper. One of them tells you to read things diagonally, and down, like a zig zag, then go back up, and zig zag the other way.
They're supposed to reveal a location. Given it's English and not Japanese, it's pretty hard to make the puzzle work without it seeming weird.
The contents of the pieces of paper are as follows:

HO / ST
UN / RA
IN / DG

Which is supposed to be read as HORAINSTUNDG. Which makes no sense. It's supposed to convey, Horadori (Hora) Genetics Institute (Inst) Underground (Undg). To be fair, all you're really supposed to do is type in HORAINSTUNDG when prompted, but doesn't that kind of sound stupid? When doing this puzzle, I saw that being the obvious answer and thought, "wow, that's stupid. Why would that be the answer? Let's think about it longer. There must be something I missed."
In Japanese,

ホ ン
チ ラ
ゲ カ

Which solves as ホラゲンチカ -> HoraGen Chika, which translates to HoraGen (or more obviously, Horadori Genetics) Underground / Basement. HoraGen Basement. That's a hell of a lot easier to understand than HORAINSTUNDG, mostly because chika is an actual word and not a messed up abbreviation.
In fact, the way I solved the puzzle was by listening to the Japanese voicelines reading out the papers, figuring out what chika meant via dictionary, and then just having the confidence to enter HORAINSTUNDG.
It felt stupid. I can't really say there's a better way of doing this. It's just what happens in localization with some things being impossible to bring over smoothly.

This is random, but I really liked some of the small additions the game made. The Tamagotchi-like Eyeballie was fun to take care of and provided nice breaks from the gameplay to ponder random questions, such as "what kind of chocolate do you like?"
Some people would probably think it's annoying, though. The prompt for it would come up, very often, during tense situations. Something like, "we just found a body!" would halfway get the tension taken out simply by me seeing the Eyeballie prompt and thinking, "oh hang on Mr. Dead Body, I have to answer a question for my Eyeballie".
The AI's rooms were fun as well, if only for the "Counseling" being strangely very supportive. You're kind of given a prompt to answer, like, "are you having troubles with your social life?" or "are you annoyed at work?" and depending on your answer, you'd have them say "go out and make some friends with a loner like yourself" or "just quit your job" or "you don't have to get along with everyone, that's unrealistic."

As I did with AITSF, I really recommend AINI. It's an incredibly engaging adventure visual novel with good characters and a very interesting case for you to try to wrap your brain around. The escape room-like puzzles are well made and fun to solve.
