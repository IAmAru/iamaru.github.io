      <h2>1game1week - Week 42 (10/15/25) - Silent Hill f</h2>
      <p>Hey all! It's week 42! (10/15 -> 10/22)<br>
        Well well well... look who the cat dragged in... me forgetting to post because I've been absorbed with Legends Z-A... Heh... Been a long time, bucko.<br>
        Totally slipped my mind. I went to the midnight release of Legends Z-A on Wednesday and have been playing since (I'm currently right under 50 hours). Thanks to my friend Kareny who reminded me to get off my ass and post.<br>
        I'll talk a little more about the midnight release experience next week (read: this Wednesday). While I'm sure I had stuff in my mind I would have otherwise talked about in this intro section last week, I guess those thoughts will forever be lost to the ether.<br>
        You know, getting my Silent Hill f preorder was a tiny bit of a chore since I was in Las Vegas at the time. My mom did me the awesome favor of going to pick it up and fistfighting the worker because they didn't have any steelbook preorder bonuses. Eventually, GameStop did end up calling me to have me come in and pick one up, so all's well that ends well, right?<br>
        It's a little ridiculous how much the steelbooks have been going for online. They seem to be a the 30-50 dollar range. It's a steelbook, man! It was supposed to be free!<br>
        <br>
        Anyways!<br>

        And onto 1g1w. Once again, a game is considered "beaten" if I've accomplished the main objective of the game.<br>

        I don't intend to make this a very long post. As a series, Silent Hill is very story-driven. It's not that this entry doesn't have non-story related elements, it just so happens to be what it's famous for, and I really don't want to spoil this story for anyone.<br>
        Some may be unaware, but this game's story was written by Ryukishi07. Ryukishi07's most popular works include Higurashi and Umineko (When They Cry) which is a series I've been slowly chipping away at these past couple of years. It probably goes without saying but I think he's an incredible writer.<br>
        To me, his works have never failed to cause introspection. It's a good thing to be able to make your reader question everything, or understand the characters' struggles and relate to their own, or have larger social commentary in an otherwise already well-written story.<br>
        <br>
        Silent Hill f does not fail at providing a certified Ryukishi07 banger, which is all I'm willing to talk about the story because I would not want to take that away from anyone (though if asked I can yap). Truly, I really recommend to just pick up the game, even on Story difficulty, and play. It's decently long, but I promise it's worth it.<br>
        <br>
        Moving to the actual gameplay, in Silent Hill f, the combat is closer to a -Souls game than it is to something akin to Silent Hill 2 Remake, where it was quite a bit "less BS, more hitting stuff and stuff hitting you". In Silent Hill f, you get various weapons with durability, such as a steel pipe, a baseball bat, kitchen knife, etc.<br>
        Even in the hardest difficulty, Lost in the Fog, I never really had issues with durability as the game very frequently gives you different weapons to replace your old ones. You're limited to three weapons which seems about realistic for someone to carry around.<br>
        Instead of no-frills combat, Silent Hill has a perfect dodge and parry system. You can perfect dodge anything, even command grabs, and you can parry certain moves. When an enemy attacks, you'll have a few frames where the game visually cues you to press the Heavy attack button. This skips the Heavy startup animation, deals a load of damage, and leaves your opponent stunned for whatever next action you'd like to do.<br>
        You're also dealing with stamina, which means you'll have to consider your actions and how much stamina they take before doing so or you'll suffer a couple second penalty. You can also "build" Hinako by equipping Omamori, which grant different abilities. By the end of the game, I had a really nasty build that let you parry off of perfect dodges at the cost of draining your stamina, making perfect dodges easier, etc. It essentially made Hinako into a killing machine, which made Lost in the Fog a tiny bit easier for me.<br>
        While the combat is fun and tense, there is one particularly annoying monster type in the game that shows up at various points throughout the story and impedes all progression until you kill it. To make things simple, I'll just say it "spawns" more enemies in a typically enclosed area, all the while having a huge amount of health.<br>
        Some very heavy story moments in the game have the flow completely interrupted by these. Comparing it once again to Silent Hill 2, the game knows when to stop making you deal with combat so you can be immersed in the story. During the moments I described, Silent Hill f failed in keeping the story's tension by halting progression until you defeated two or three health sponges.<br>
        As a side note, I had a couple funny glitches regarding one of the game's bosses' behavior. One time, I was command grabbed, opened an item menu / mashed, and was released. The other, the enemy just stopped. I took a video of that one, and my reaction during gameplay kind of say it all. "It's not moving... can I just...?" and starting to hit it over and over until I stunned it so the behavior fixed itself.<br>
        <br>
        Puzzles in this game are relatively simple. Even across difficulties, they're not too bad. Most of the puzzles were the same across every difficulty, eg. Puzzle A is still Puzzle A, but they vary out the wording and the overall solution. If in Story difficulty, the solution is A, B, and C go into 1, 2 and 3 respectively, then maybe in Lost in the Fog the solution is B, C, and A go into 1, 2, and 3 respectively. I'm describing it this way only for the sake of being overly simplistic.<br>
        I think it would've been cooler to have completely different puzzles between difficulties, but some of them are just interwoven into the narrative and aren't easy to change out.<br>
        <br>
        Silent Hill f features four story endings and one Alien ending, with different requirements that are outlined in a menu once you finish your first playthrough. They're best enjoyed in the order from the menu (Normal -> Bad -> Good (more so neutral) -> True)<br>
        Somehow, it really felt like going from one Higurashi arc to the next, as each subsequent playthrough more so "continues" the story. This is probably intentional... it is Ryukishi07, after all.<br>
        <br>
        It's a little annoying typing this, because I truly could go on and on and on about everything I loved about Silent Hill f. But it's my moral duty to keep you guys without spoilers. So... go and play it!<br>
